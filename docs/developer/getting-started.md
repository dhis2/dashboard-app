## What are plugins?

Plugins are a way to extend the functionality of the core applications within the DHIS2 ecosystem.
Plugins act and feel like native widgets / components, and allow you to write custom code that is injected into the core applications
without having to fork or maintain a separate version of the Dashboard app.

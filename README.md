This project was bootstrapped with [DHIS2 Application Platform](https://github.com/dhis2/app-platform).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In order for maps, event reports and event charts to display, you need to provide the api server instance in the environment variable `REACT_APP_DHIS2_BASE_URL`.

You can provide this inline, for example:
`REACT_APP_DHIS2_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 yarn start`

You can also set this in a `.env*.local` file or straight up as an environment variable in your local system.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner and runs all available tests found in `/src`.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/test) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
A deployable `.zip` file can be found in `build/bundle`!

See the section about [building](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/build) for more information.
